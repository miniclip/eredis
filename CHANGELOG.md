## v1.1.0

- Merged a ton of of old and neglected pull requests. Thanks to
  patient contributors:
  - Emil Falk
  - Evgeny Khramtsov
  - Kevin Wilson
  - Luis Rascão
  - Аверьянов Илья (savonarola on github)
  - ololoru
  - Giacomo Olgeni

- Removed rebar binary, made everything a bit more rebar3 & mix
  friendly.

## v1.0.8

- Fixed include directive to work with rebar 2.5.1. Thanks to Feng Hao
  for the patch.

## v1.0.7

- If an eredis_sub_client needs to reconnect to Redis, the controlling
  process is now notified with the message `{eredis_reconnect_attempt,
  Pid}`. If the reconnection attempt fails, the message is
  `{eredis_reconnect_failed, Pid, Reason}`. Thanks to Piotr Nosek for
  the patch.

- No more deprecation warnings of the `queue` type on OTP 17. Thanks
  to Daniel Kempkens for the patch.

- Various spec fixes. Thanks to Hernan Rivas Acosta and Anton Kalyaev.

## v1.0.6

- If the connection to Redis is lost, requests in progress will
  receive `{error, tcp_closed}` instead of the `gen_server:call`
  timing out. Thanks to Seth Falcon for the patch.

## v1.0.5

- Added support for not selecting any specific database. Thanks to
  Mikl Kurkov for the patch.

## v1.0.4

- Added `eredis:q_noreply/2` which sends a fire-and-forget request to
  Redis. Thanks to Ransom Richardson for the patch.

- Various type annotation improvements, typo fixes and robustness
  improvements. Thanks to Michael Gregson, Matthew Conway and Ransom
  Richardson.

## v1.0.3

- Fixed bug in eredis_sub where when the connection to Redis was lost,
  the socket would not be set into {active, once} on reconnect. Thanks
  to georgeye for the patch.

## v1.0.2

- Fixed bug in eredis_sub where the socket was incorrectly set to
  `{active, once}` twice. At large volumes of messages, this resulted
  in too many messages from the socket and we would be unable to keep
  up. Thanks to pmembrey for reporting.

## v1.0

- Support added for pubsub thanks to Dave Peticolas
  (jdavisp3). Implemented in `eredis_sub` and `eredis_sub_client` is a
  subscriber that will forward messages from Redis to an Erlang
  process with flow control. The user can configure to either drop
  messages or crash the driver if a certain queue size inside the
  driver is reached.

- Fixed error handling when eredis starts up and Redis is still
  loading the dataset into memory.

## v0.7.0

- Support added for pipelining requests, which allows batching
  multiple requests in a single call to eredis. Thanks to Dave
  Peticolas (jdavisp3) for the implementation.

## v0.6.0

- Support added for transactions, by Dave Peticolas (jdavisp3) who implemented
  parsing of nested multibulks.

## v0.5.0

- Configurable reconnect sleep time, by Valentino Volonghi (dialtone)

- Support for using eredis as a poolboy worker, by Valentino Volonghi
  (dialtone)
